# Playwright E2E Tests

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js (>= 18.12.0) and Yarn (>= 1.22.19) installed on your system.

### Install Dependencies

From the project root directory, install all dependencies including Playwright:

```bash
# Install all project dependencies (including Playwright)
yarn install

# Install Playwright browsers
yarn playwright install

# Optional: Install only Chromium browser for faster setup
yarn playwright install chromium
```

### Verify Installation

You can verify that Playwright is properly installed by running:

```bash
# Check Playwright version
yarn playwright --version

# List available tests (without running them)
yarn playwright test --list
```

## Setup

### Environment Variables

The tests support multiple authentication methods and cloud provider configurations. All environment variables should be configured in the `playwright.env.json` file.

#### Authentication Methods

The tests support:

- **Username/Password Authentication**: Standard Red Hat SSO login

1. **Username/Password Authentication (Primary)**:
   - `TEST_WITHQUOTA_USER` - Username for test authentication
   - `TEST_WITHQUOTA_PASSWORD` - Password for test authentication

#### Configuration Files

The test configuration uses `playwright.env.json` for environment-specific settings. All authentication credentials, cloud provider settings, infrastructure configurations, and test environment options are mapped in this file.

            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Note**: Create your own `playwright.env.json` file based on this structure. This file is not part of the repository and should not be committed to version control as it contains sensitive credentials.

### Running Tests

#### Using custom playwright script commands (Recommended)

```bash
# Run all tests in headless mode (CI/CD mode)
yarn playwright-headless

# Run tests with UI mode (interactive test explorer)
yarn playwright-ui

# Run tests in headed mode (see browser actions)
yarn playwright-headed

# Run tests in debug mode (step through tests)
yarn playwright-debug

# Show HTML test report
yarn playwright-report
```

#### Using Playwright CLI Directly

For more advanced usage and customized options:

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn playwright test

# Run specific test file
yarn playwright test playwright/e2e/clusters/register-cluster.spec.ts

# Run tests for specific directory
yarn playwright test playwright/e2e/downloads/

# Run with specific browser
BROWSER=chromium yarn playwright test

# Run with specific reporter
yarn playwright test --reporter=html

# Run with parallel executions in multiple workers
yarn playwright test --workers=<count>

# Run the tests with specific tags
yarn playwright test --grep="<tag>"

# Generate test code (record browser interactions)
yarn playwright codegen
```

### Authentication

The tests use a global setup that:

1. Loads environment variables from `playwright.env.json`
2. Performs authentication once before all tests run
3. Saves authentication state to `playwright/fixtures/storageState.json`
4. Reuses this state across all test runs
5. Sets necessary cookies to disable consent dialogs

#### Authentication Flow

1. **Global Setup** (`playwright/support/global-setup.ts`):

   - Creates a browser context with proper viewport settings
   - Sets GDPR consent cookies to bypass consent dialogs
   - Handles different authentication methods based on environment

2. **Login Process** (`playwright/page-objects/login-page.ts`):
   - **Standard Flow**: Username → Next → Password → Submit
   - **FedRAMP Flow**: Direct username/password entry for GOV_CLOUD environments

#### Session Management

- Authentication state is persisted in `storageState.json`
- Tests automatically reuse saved authentication without re-login
- Global timeout: 5 minutes per test
- Navigation timeout: 60 seconds
- Action timeout: 15 seconds

This approach is faster and more reliable than logging in for each test.

### Page Object Fixture Pattern

This project uses **Playwright fixtures** for dependency injection of page objects, providing automatic setup/teardown and proper resource management.

#### Fixture Scope: Worker-Scoped

All page object fixtures are **worker-scoped**, meaning:

- Created **once per worker** (suite-level)
- **Shared across all tests** within that worker
- Perfect for **serial test flows** where tests build on each other
- Efficient - **no re-instantiation overhead**
- Automatic cleanup when worker ends

#### Basic Usage

Import the custom `test` and `expect` from fixtures:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '../../fixtures/pages';

test.describe.serial('Register cluster flow', () => {
  test.beforeAll(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('cluster-list');
  });

  test('navigate to register cluster', async ({ clusterListPage }) => {
    // Page object automatically injected, no manual setup!
    await clusterListPage.registerCluster().click();
  });

  test('fill cluster details', async ({ registerClusterPage }) => {
    // Same page instance, state maintained from previous test
    await registerClusterPage.clusterIDInput().fill('my-cluster');
  });
});
```

#### Benefits

✅ **No Manual Initialization** - Page objects injected automatically  
✅ **Worker-Scoped Reuse** - Created once, shared across suite tests  
✅ **Type-Safe** - Full TypeScript support with IntelliSense  
✅ **Automatic Cleanup** - Resources properly disposed  
✅ **State Persistence** - Perfect for serial user flows


### Configuration Files

- `playwright.config.ts` - Main Playwright configuration
- `playwright.env.json` - Environment-specific variables (This is not part of repo)

### Troubleshooting

#### Authentication Issues

1. **Invalid Credentials**: Verify environment variables in `playwright.env.json`

#### Environment Issues

1. **Wrong Base URL**: Check `baseURL` in `playwright.config.ts` matches target environment
2. **Network Connectivity**: Verify access to target environment (staging/production)
3. **GOV_CLOUD Settings**: Ensure `GOV_CLOUD=true` for FedRAMP environments

#### Test Execution Issues

1. **Timeout Errors**: Tests include extended timeouts (5 minutes per test, 60s navigation)
2. **Loading Issues**: Tests wait for skeleton loaders and spinners to disappear
3. **Browser Issues**: Try different browsers using `BROWSER` environment variable

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Problems

- **Solution**: Delete `playwright/fixtures/storageState.json` to force re-authentication (only required for local runs)
- **Root Cause**: Expired or corrupted authentication state

#### Environment Variable Issues

- **Solution**: Verify all required variables are set in `playwright.env.json`
- **Check**: Run `yarn playwright test --list` to verify configuration loading

## GitHub Actions Workflows

The project includes two GitHub Actions workflows for running Playwright tests in CI/CD pipelines.

### E2E CI Playwright (`e2e-ci-playwright.yml`)

This workflow runs on every pull request and push to the main branch, executing tests against a local dev server.

#### Triggers

- **Pull Requests**: Automatically runs on opened, synchronized, reopened, or ready_for_review events
- **Push to Main**: Runs when code is pushed to the `main` branch
- **Manual Dispatch**: Can be triggered manually from the Actions tab

#### Key Features

- **Local Dev Server**: Spins up a local development server for test execution
- **Parallel Execution**: Defaults to 4 parallel workers
- **Artifact Upload**: Uploads test artifacts on failure for debugging

#### Manual Dispatch Options

| Input | Description | Default | Options |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `browser` | Browser to run tests on | `chromium` | chrome, chromium, firefox, webkit |
| `workers` | Number of parallel workers | `4` | 1, 2, 3, 4 |


### E2E Smoke Playwright (`e2e-smoke-playwright.yml`)

This workflow runs daily smoke tests against staging/production environments with full cloud resource setup.

#### Triggers

- **Scheduled**: Runs daily at 7:00 AM UTC (`0 7 * * *`)
- **Manual Dispatch**: Can be triggered manually with custom parameters

#### Key Features

- **Multi-Environment Support**: Can target staging, production, or local environments
- **Cloud Resource Setup**: Automatically configures AWS CLI, ROSA CLI, and creates necessary IAM roles
- **Tag-Based Filtering**: Run specific test suites using Playwright's grep pattern (e.g., `@smoke`, `@ci`)
- **OCP Version Control**: Optionally specify a specific OpenShift version for tests
- **Trace Collection**: Configurable trace levels for debugging
- **Slack Notifications**: Detailed test result notifications with environment info
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Cleans up AWS resources after test execution

#### Manual Dispatch Options

| Input | Description | Default | Options |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `browser` | Browser to run tests on | `chromium` | chromium, firefox, webkit |
| `EUT` | Environment Under Test | `staging` | staging, production, local |
| `grep_tags` | Test tags to filter | `@smoke` | Any valid grep pattern (e.g., `@smoke`, `@ci`, `@smoke\|@ci`) |
| `ocp_version` | OCP version for tests | (latest) | Any valid OCP version string |
| `trace_level` | Trace collection level | `off` | off, on-first-retry, retain-on-failure, on |
| `workers` | Number of parallel workers | `4` | Any positive integer |

#### Environment URLs

| Environment | Base URL |
|-------------|----------|
| `staging` | `https://console.dev.redhat.com/openshift/` |
| `production` | `https://console.redhat.com/openshift/` |
| `local` | `https://prod.foo.redhat.com:1337/openshift/` |

#### Cloud Setup (Automatic)

The smoke workflow automatically:

1. **AWS CLI Configuration**: Extracts credentials from `playwright.env.json` and configures AWS CLI
2. **VPC Infrastructure**: Creates required VPC infrastructure using `create-vpc-infrastructure.sh`
3. **ROSA CLI Login**: Authenticates using service account credentials
4. **OCM/Account Roles**: Creates OCM roles and account roles with configured prefixes
5. **Resource Cleanup**: Tears down created resources after test completion

### Viewing Test Results

1. Navigate to the repository's **Actions** tab
2. Select the workflow run to view
3. Check the **Slack channel** for automated notifications
4. Download **test artifacts** for failed runs (screenshots, videos, traces)
